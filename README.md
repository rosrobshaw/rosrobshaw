### Hi there, I'm Ros 👋

I'm a Brain and Mind Sciences Masters student, with a BA in Experimental Psychology. I'm interested in psychedelic research and what this can tell us about the brain and consciousness.  

🔭 I’m currently working on a project examining cognitive biases after psychedelic experiences 
🌱 I’m currently learning my way around GitHub, JsPsych and R. I have limited coding experience so I'm looking forwards to a steep learning curve!
